  <div class="abt" >
    <ul style="font-family: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet; padding: 20px">

  <li>We started our journey drawing inspiration from our country’s most valuable spice, cinnamon. Just like its pleasant flavour and warm aroma, we infuse a rejuvenating spirit into every experience the world discovers with us.
Today, with each property we present a new Sri Lanka that houses a contemporary outlook and a genial atmosphere. Together, they put us on the world map beyond the boundaries of hospitality. They make us a group passionate about living the true essence of each moment.</li>
<li><br> The duties of conscientious Governorship soon took their toll on King Tom, however, and poor health forced him to leave the island of Ceylon and his adored Lovina. The Governor, an honourable man, who wanted to do the very best for Lovina within the social mores of the time, presented her with a parting gift: a large piece of land in Attidiya, a village some distance away from Galkissa.

Although the departure of King Tom was to naturally seal the end of their love affair, Lovina’s name is remembered as providing the inspiration in naming the Governor’s house. Indeed, it is believed that her descendants still live in the vicinity of Mount Lavinia. The legend is the story of Lovina, how she fervently held the attention, and captured the heart of a distinguished British Governor of Ceylon.</li>
<li><br>
 ATo this day, the secret tunnel remains, keeping alive the memory and spirit of the beautiful mestizo dancer, elevated in the popular imagination to ”Lady Lavinia”.
